# Mountains are again merely mountains 
This is my first foray into the unknown and exicting world of script backend languages. Having been tired by the reckless verbosity of Java and unpleasnt nature of how async is done in Javascript I decided to learn a language that promotes writing as little code as it is possible and allows developers to deploy with no problem at all(unlike Java, which I really like, but come on... Deployment is an absolute and utter nightmare).

I really like Ruby. I like how it just flows and gives me many ways to do one thing. Koans are a great introduction to this lanugauge by utilizing the nature of unit tests and red-green refactoring by enabling even absolute beginnners with a methodology that is used by veterans. `Write code, test it, see what's wrong, fix it, test it, and so on` or`+Write test code, then code itself, then test etc..` if you're TDD purist.

I definetly will continue to explore ruby and it's capabilities for modern software development. My next stop is a web framework - either Sinatra or Rails with some TDD/BDD framework (cucumber, lettuce?)

Singin' off,

Andrew Torski.
